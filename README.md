The one dimensional array of integers is converted
into a two-dimensional array.

Both diagonals of the 2D array are reversed.

A magic number for the matrix is computed by
adding all elements of 1D array and dividing by four.
If sum of each row, each column and each diagonal
is equal to magic number, then 2D array is a magic square.
